IPS Format (general):

	IPS files are patches consisting of chunks with 24-bit offsets and
	description of bytes to write and length. They are incredibly
	simple.

	Here is what a patch would look like if you transcribed it to be
	human readable:

	PATCH

	offset: 000f40
	size: 10
	DE AD BE EF DE AD BE EF 00 00

	offset: 001267
	size: rle
	rle-size: 200
	rle-byte: 50

	EEOF

IPS32 extension:

	A rather simple extension. Offsets are 32-bit versus 24.
