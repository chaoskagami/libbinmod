 To install this:

  ./configure && make && make install

 In other words, generic autoconf. If you're too lazy to run
 these commands (seriously?), it's your lucky day. This file can be
 executed as such: sh INSTALL

 Yeah, seriously. I've deliberately started all lines with non-commands.
 There's some syntax errors, but hey.
