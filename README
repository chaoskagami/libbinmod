0) Short Installation Instructions
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you downloaded this source from git:
  autoreconf -fi && ./configure && make && make install

If you downloaded a release tarball:
  ./configure && make && make install

In other words, standard autoconf.

1) About libbinmod
------------------------------------------------------------------------

libbinmod is a set of utilities for inspecting and altering binary
files. By 'binary files', I am referring not to executables, but any
form of data blob, executable, or otherwise. This is also pretty
shitty and has been sitting on my HD for a while, so...yeah.

These (mostly) functional tools are provided.

  bgrep - Binary grep
  bsed  - Binary stream editor (incomplete)
  bips  - IPS patcher
  bxxd  - Hex dumper
  bflag - LAA flag flipper
  bwrit - Binary insertion

------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) Goals and Motivation
------------------------------------------------------------------------

libbinmod was created out of frustration with current binary editing
tools. Essentially, your choices now boil down to one of the following:

  * A graphical hex editor
  * xdelta3
  * One of numerous bgrep implementations

This is inadequate. For many reasons, not limited to the following:

  * dd is not a good stream editor, and sed has limited usability on
    binaries, at least safely so.
  * Un-hexdumping is complicated by the multiple tools available.
    There's xxd, hexdump, etc. All with different formats.
  * xdelta is not a plaintext or readable format. It is special purpose,
    and while it fares well, for smaller jobs a tool that operates on
    plaintext would be nice.
  * All of the many bgrep tools are not feature complete.
    They might not be able to print context, display, etc.
  * There's a lack of IPS patchers on linux.

4) Tool-specific Information
------------------------------------------------------------------------

----- 4.1) bgrep

    Binary grep isn't a terribly new concept. It is however, not handled
    by GNU grep, and it is also done rather terribly in the numerous
    implementations. grep's greatest strength is in the flexibility of
    output that makes usage of the output elsewhere possible.

    None of the implementations of bgrep I have tried provide this.

    Not that my implementation does either, but hey. I'm trying at least.

----- 4.2) bsed

    Just a dump search and replace tool. Move along now. Maybe someday.

----- 4.3) bips

    bips is an IPS/IPS32 patcher. IPS and IPS32 are patch formats
    commonly used in ROM hacks and game modifications. They offer no
    contextual information, however, so once a patch is applied it
    cannot be reverted without generating a patch backwards.

    IPS is much more common than IPS32. However, it has a hard limit on
    file size of 2^24-1 bytes, or 16M. This makes it useless on larger
    files, which is why BPS/beat was used for Mother 3's fan translation
    for example.

    IPS32 is a variant of IPS which rather than get fancy like BPS or
    xdelta, just fixes what broke and uses 32-bit offsets. Some of the
    touhoumon rom hacks were distributed in this format. 2^32-1 is 4GB,
    which is not likely to be hit since IPS has been largely obsoleted
    already.

    Additionally, there is an extension to the above used by Lunar IPS -
    a truncation/expansion value immediately after the end. I'm unsure
    if this can occur in IPS32; regardless, I check for a four-byte
    value anyways.

----- 4.4) bxxd

    Another hexdump implementation.

----- 4.5) bflag

    Flips the large address flag in windows executables.

----- 4.6) bwrit

    Writes a value to a file. Useful as a substitute for quick hex edits.
